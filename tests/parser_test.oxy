Inpired by an artcle from reddit discussing a syntax for combining if and match/switch stucture into a
unified stucture that support both types of conditionals.

The semantic meaning would change when it is this style of if.
if x {
  | in 10..20: {

  },
  | < 10: {

  },
  | == 10 : {

  },
  | > 10: {

  },
  | _: {
    
  }
}

enum Bar {
  Foo(...),
  Bee(...)
}

let y = Bar.Foo(...)

if y {
  | Foo(...) {

  }
  | Bee(...) {

  }
}
